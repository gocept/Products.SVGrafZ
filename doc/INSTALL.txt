 Installation
==============

Requirements
------------

  - Zope-Version: tested 2.11+ should do fine

  - Python 2.2 or newer


Recomandations
--------------
 * For generating PNG-Images or PDF-Files for Browsers which have no SVG-Support
     resp. printers:

     + batikServer (which needs also batikRasterizer) -- batikServer is about
       3 times faster than batikRasterizer
       http://www.gocept.com/angebot/opensource/BatikServer

     + or only batikRasterizer from
        batik-1.5 or higher from http://xml.apache.org/batik/
        (Binary distribution is fine.)

 * Tested Batik versions: 1.5beta5, 1.5, 1.5.1

Tested Zope versions
--------------------

- 2.11.7

Installation

Documentation
-------------

- Get your first SVGrafZ-Diagram by reading `doc/USING.txt`.

- Some documentation can be found under Zope-Help. (Zope 2.11)

- When you choose a diagramkind or a converter you get information about its
  capabilities.

- Some docs are also in the doc directory and some (maybe old) german ones are
  in `doc/german`.

- For all other documentation needs: Use the source, luke. (sorry for that)
