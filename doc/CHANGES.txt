1.1 (unreleased)
----------------

- Nothing changed yet.


1.0.0 (2010-12-15)
------------------

  - Refactored to be an egg, so it can be used in Zope 2.11.

0.22.11 (2007-11-16)
--------------------

  - Bugfix: If the x- or y-values where strings which are convertable to float
    they would be handled like floats, but this failed later because they
    are no floats.

0.22.10 (2006-12-14)
--------------------

  - Bugfix: Whether there were in an ABC analysis diagramm more rows
    to display than the diagram width in pixels than nothing was
    displayed.

0.22.9 (2006-09-25)
-------------------

  - Bugfix: hasLegend-Method now also returns true, if the legend is a dict.

0.22.8 (2006-07-19)
-------------------

  - Added possibility to give an URL for the graph which is different from its
    absolute or relative URL.

  - Avoid converting any values on one axis to float if one value on that axis
    can't be converted.

  - Added a keyword parameter to ``SVGraphZProduct.html()`` to switch between
    absolute and relative URLs so graphs found by acquisition may be rendered
    in the appropriate context. Default is to keep creating absolute URLs.

  - Added a keyword parameter to ``SVGraphZProduct.html()`` to pass additional
    query arguments.

0.22.7 (2006-03-07)
-------------------

 - Added some documentation in USAGE.txt

0.22.6 (2005-04-07)
-------------------

  - It is not possible any more to start BatikServer from inside Zope. (This
    made big problems with Zope running as a service on Windows.)
    Use `BatikServer` 0.3.0 (or higher) which runs as a daemon or service.

  - Added possibility to check if BatikServer is running (see
    ``__init__.py``).



0.22.5 (2005-02-28)
-------------------

  - Configuration is now easier: SVGrafZ comes with two examples for
    german and english. See doc/INSTALL.py how to use them.

  - some bug fixes

  - refactoring:

    - tests: now using ZopeTestCase

    - imports: now using absolute pathes for import

0.22.4 (2005-02-11)
-------------------

  - Added documentation.

0.22.3 (2004-07-29)
-------------------

-------------------

  - Little textual changes.

0.22.1 (2004-03-24)
